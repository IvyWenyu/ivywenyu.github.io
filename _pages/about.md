I am a postgradute student majoring in Operations Research. I obtain my bachelor degree in Shanghai University and Finance and Economics. I am broadly interested in optimization, particularly in following areas. For me, theories are the fundamental navigations, and applications are the way how our dreams come true. I always endeavour to become a well-round person in both these two fields.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Dr.Xueting Cui](https://math.sufe.edu.cn/aa/a0/c2019a43680/page.htm) from [School of Mathematics](https://math.sufe.edu.cn/), [SUFE](https://www.sufe.edu.cn/) for my master degree. 

Research Interests
======
Optimization under uncertainty, decision-making problems, matrix optimization
